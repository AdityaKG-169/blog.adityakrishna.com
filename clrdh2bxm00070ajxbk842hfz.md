In the ever-evolving landscape of machine learning and natural language processing, vector embeddings stand out as a powerful and versatile concept. These mathematical representations of words, phrases, or entities have become the backbone of various applications, offering a nuanced understanding of language and context.

In this blog post, we will unravel the essence of vector embeddings, exploring what they are, how they work, their significance, and the diverse use cases that make them indispensable in the realm of artificial intelligence.

Let's begin!

### Why do we need Vector Embeddings?

Before we delve into the technical aspects of vector embeddings, it's essential to understand the 'why' behind them.

Vector embeddings serve as the foundation for many search applications, chatbots, and AI assistants we use today. They offer a way to mathematically represent the **meaning** behind a user's query and find the most relevant response. Without them, we are limited to keyword-based searches, where the engine matches keywords in your query with available data.

Vector embeddings enable the generation of results tailored to your query by understanding its meaning. Let me illustrate this with a few examples.

Imagine you input the query: "Apple's latest products." Without proper context, 'Apple' could refer to the company and the fruit. For the search engine to provide correct and relevant responses, it needs to grasp the context, not just rely on keyword matching.

For the second example, consider two sentences:

1. "Best restaurants in Paris"
    
2. "Top dining experiences in the heart of the French capital."
    

Although these sentences convey the same meaning, they don't share relevant keywords. A basic keyword-matching algorithm would yield an incorrect result. In contrast, vector embeddings capture the meaning behind the data.

### What are Vector Embeddings?

Before we dive into what vector embeddings are, let's take a quick look at vectors. Picture a vector as an arrow. It has a length and always points in a direction, anywhere, really. That's it – a vector is like a point in space, with its "direction" as an arrow from the starting point to that spot in the vector space.

Here's an image representing a vector with a length of √2 and an angle of 45 degrees with both the x and y coordinates.

In programming, we can represent vectors like this:

```python
# Example 1
vector_1 = [1,1] # (1,1) in x-y plane

# Example 2
vector_2 = [-2,5,2 .... n] # some point in an n-dimensional space
```

In a space with multiple vectors, each vector has a certain distance from others. In the figure below, you can see vectors in a plane with different magnitudes and directions. Some are close, while others are far apart. We'll use these properties to do exciting things.

Now that we know what vectors are, let's use this knowledge to understand vector embeddings.

Imagine we want to build a search engine that retrieves data based on an algorithm that doesn't rely on keyword matching but understands the meaning behind your query. To capture this meaning or semantic, we need to convert it into a vector. Now, this process isn't straightforward. We need to use an **embedding model** to convert your query (or any data) into vectors. These models take information (text, image, audio, etc.) as input and convert it into a vector of some variable dimension (each model has its properties).

There are several embedding models in the industry, each serving its purpose. You can even convert audio and images into vectors. Some popular models include Word2Vec (by Google) and Ada (by OpenAI). These models are built by passing a large amount of labeled data to a neural network.

Vectors close together show contextual similarity, while those far apart are different. This is what gives our vector meaning – its relationship with other vectors depends on how the embedding model "understands" the domain it was trained on.

### How to use Vector Embeddings?

Let's go back to our search engine example; we aim to get information that fits the context of users' queries. We've already talked about using vectors for this. But how exactly? Let me explain by breaking down this process into three steps.

1. Convert your existing data into vector embeddings and store them in a database. Usually, we use vector databases like Pinecone, Chroma, etc., for this.
    
2. Use the same embedding model from step 1 to turn the user's query into a vector.
    
3. **Compare** the user's query with the vectors in your database and retrieve the ones that best match the criteria.
    

There are various methods to compare two vectors. We can calculate the Euclidean distance between them, where the ones with the least distance are most similar. Alternatively, we can use the dot product or cosine similarity to determine how similar a pair of vectors are. You can learn more about distance metrics [here](https://weaviate.io/blog/distance-metrics-in-vector-search).

### Practical Uses of Vector Embeddings

As mentioned earlier, vector embeddings play a crucial role in various applications, from search to AI chatbots. You can apply different similarity techniques to harness the power of embeddings across a wide range of areas. Here are a few examples:

**Recommendation System:** Use similarity algorithms to find items similar to those preferred by your users.

**Semantic Search:** Create search engines that not just match keywords but also understand the meaning behind users' queries for better results.

**Anomaly Detection:** Utilize similarity algorithms to identify unusual patterns or outliers in your data.

**Question Answering Applications:** Develop applications that operate on your specific data and answer users' queries based on meaning rather than just keywords.

These are just a glimpse of the numerous possibilities that vector embeddings offer in the realm of artificial intelligence. Their versatility extends to applications like sentiment analysis, content summarization, and even image and speech processing. The ability of vector embeddings to capture contextual relationships makes them a valuable tool in creating more intelligent and responsive systems across a broad spectrum of domains.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, vector embeddings represent a crucial advancement in natural language processing, enabling machines to move beyond keyword matching and grasp the intricate meanings and contexts within human language. As we continue to explore and refine these mathematical representations, the potential for innovation and improved AI applications becomes even more promising. The journey into the world of vector embeddings is one of continuous discovery and application, shaping the future of artificial intelligence.
